Automation Account comes very handy in privilege escalation:
- Usually, high privileges for managed identity
- often clear-text credentials can be found in Runbooks. 
- Access to connections, keyvaults from a runbook
- Ability to run commands on on-prem VMs if hybrid workers are in use. 
- Ability to run commands on VMs using DSC in configuration management.
